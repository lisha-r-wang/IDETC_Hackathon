V - VEHICLE REQUIREMENTS
V.1 CONFIGURATION
The vehicle must be open wheeled and open cockpit (a formula style body) with four wheels
that are not in a straight line.
V.1.1 Open Wheel
Open Wheel vehicles must satisfy all of the following criteria:
a. The top 180° of the wheels/tires must be unobstructed when viewed from vertically
above the wheel.
b. The wheels/tires must be unobstructed when viewed from the side.
c. No part of the vehicle may enter a keep out zone defined by two lines extending
vertically from positions 75 mm in front of and 75 mm aft of, the outer diameter of the
front and rear tires in the side view elevation of the vehicle, with tires steered straight
ahead. This keep out zone will extend laterally from the outside plane of the wheel/tire
to the inboard plane of the wheel/tire.
75 mm 75 mm 75 mm 75 mm
No Parts allowed

View of this Surface
must be unobstructed
V.1.2 Wheelbase
The vehicle must have a minimum wheelbase of 1525 mm
V.1.3 Vehicle Track
V.1.3.1 The track and center of gravity must combine to provide sufficient rollover stability. See
IN.9.2
V.1.3.2 The smaller track of the vehicle (front or rear) must be no less than 75% of the larger track.

V.1.4 Ground Clearance
V.1.4.1 Ground clearance must be sufficient to prevent any portion of the vehicle except the tires
from touching the ground during dynamic events
V.1.4.2 The distance to the ground below the Lower Side Impact Structure ( F.6.4.5, F.7.5.1 ) at its
lowest point should be 75 mm or less
V.1.4.3 Intentional or excessive ground contact of any portion of the vehicle other than the tires will
forfeit a run or an entire dynamic event
The intent is that sliding skirts or other devices that by design, fabrication or as a consequence
of moving, contact the track surface are prohibited and any unintended contact with the
ground which causes damage, or in the opinion of the Dynamic Event Officials could result in
damage to the track, will result in forfeit of a run or an entire dynamic event
V.2 DRIVER
V.2.1 Accommodation
V.2.1.1 The vehicle must be able to accommodate drivers of sizes ranging from 5th percentile female
up to 95th percentile male.
• Accommodation includes driver position, driver controls, and driver equipment.
• Anthropometric data may be found on the FSAE Online Website.
V.2.1.2 The driver’s head and hands must not contact the ground in any rollover attitude.
V.2.2 Visibility
a. The driver must have sufficient visibility to the front and sides of the vehicle
b. When seated in a normal driving position, the driver must have a minimum field of vision
of 100° to both sides
c. If mirrors are required for this rule, they must remain in place and adjusted to enable the
required visibility throughout all dynamic events.
V.3 SUSPENSION AND STEERING
V.3.1 Suspension
V.3.1.1 The vehicle must have a fully operational suspension system with shock absorbers, front and
rear, with usable minimum wheel travel of 50 mm, with a driver seated.
V.3.1.2 Officials may disqualify vehicles which do not represent a serious attempt at an operational
suspension system, or which demonstrate handling inappropriate for an autocross circuit.
V.3.1.3 All suspension mounting points must be visible at Technical Inspection by direct view or by
removing any covers.
V.3.1.4 Fasteners in the Suspension system are Critical Fasteners, see T.8.2
V.3.1.5 All spherical rod ends and spherical bearings on the suspension and steering must be one of:
• Mounted in double shear
• Captured by having a screw/bolt head or washer with an outside diameter that is larger
than spherical bearing housing inside diameter.
V.3.2 Steering
V.3.2.1 The Steering Wheel must be mechanically connected to the front wheels

Version 1.0 1 Sep 2023
V.3.2.2 Electrically actuated steering of the front wheels is prohibited
V.3.2.3 Steering systems must use a rigid mechanical linkage capable of tension and compression
loads for operation
V.3.2.4 The steering system must have positive steering stops that prevent the steering linkages from
locking up (the inversion of a four bar linkage at one of the pivots). The stops:
a. Must prevent the wheels and tires from contacting suspension, bodywork, or Chassis
during the track events
b. May be placed on the uprights or on the rack
V.3.2.5 Allowable steering system free play is limited to seven degrees (7°) total measured at the
steering wheel.
V.3.2.6 The steering rack must be mechanically attached to the Chassis F.5.14
V.3.2.7 Joints between all components attaching the Steering Wheel to the steering rack must be
mechanical and be visible at Technical Inspection. Bonded joints without a mechanical backup
are not permitted.
V.3.2.8 Fasteners in the steering system are Critical Fasteners, see T.8.2
V.3.2.9 Spherical rod ends and spherical bearings in the steering must meet V.3.1.5 above
V.3.2.10 Rear wheel steering may be used.
a. Rear wheel steering must incorporate mechanical stops to limit the range of angular
movement of the rear wheels to a maximum of six degrees (6°).
b. The team must provide the ability for the steering angle range to be verified at Technical
Inspection with a driver in the vehicle.
c. Rear wheel steering may be electrically actuated.
V.3.3 Steering Wheel
V.3.3.1 In any angular position, the Steering Wheel must meet T.1.4.4
V.3.3.2 The Steering Wheel must be attached to the column with a quick disconnect.
V.3.3.3 The driver must be able to operate the quick disconnect while in the normal driving position
with gloves on.
V.3.3.4 The Steering Wheel must have a continuous perimeter that is near circular or near oval.
The outer perimeter profile may have some straight sections, but no concave sections. “H”,
“Figure 8”, or cutout wheels are not allowed.
V.4 WHEELS AND TIRES
V.4.1 Wheel Size
Wheels must be 203.2 mm (8.0 inches) or more in diameter.
V.4.2 Wheel Attachment
V.4.2.1 Any wheel mounting system that uses a single retaining nut must incorporate a device to
retain the nut and the wheel if the nut loosens.
A second nut (jam nut) does not meet this requirement
V.4.2.2 Teams using modified lug bolts or custom designs must provide proof that Good Engineering
Practices have been followed in their design.
V.4.2.3 If used, aluminum wheel nuts must be hard anodized and in pristine condition.

Any grooves that have been cut must have documented proof that this rule was met
• There is a minimum tread depth of 2.4 mm
V.4.3.3 Tire Set
a. All four Dry Tires and Wheels or all four Wet Tires and Wheels do not have to be
identical.
b. Once each tire set has been presented for Technical Inspection, any tire compound or
size, or wheel type or size must not be changed.
V.4.3.4 Tire Pressure
a. Tire Pressure must be in the range allowed by the manufacturer at all times.
b. Tire Pressure may be inspected at any time
