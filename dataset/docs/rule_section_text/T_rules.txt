a pull-up or pull-down resistor to bring an open circuit input to 0% Pedal Travel

T.4.2.4 Implausibility is defined as a deviation of more than 10% Pedal Travel between the sensors or
other failure as defined in this Section T.4.2. Use of values larger than 10% Pedal Travel
require justification in the ETC Systems Form and may not be approved

msec, the power to the (IC) Electronic Throttle / (EV) Motor(s) must be immediately stopped
completely.
Formula SAE® Rules 2024 © 2023 SAE International Page 64 of 140
Version 1.0 1 Sep 2023
(EV only) It is not necessary to Open the Shutdown Circuit, the motor controller(s) stopping
the power to the Motor(s) is sufficient.
T.4.2.6 If three sensors are used, then in the case of an APPS failure, any two sensors that agree
within 10% Pedal Travel may be used to define the (IC) throttle position / (EV) torque target
and the 3rd APPS may be ignored.
T.4.2.7 Each APPS must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of the two:
• A separate detachable connector that enables a check of functions by unplugging it
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each APPS
signal.
T.4.2.8 The APPS signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a digital
data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay.
T.4.2.9 Any failure of the APPS or APPS wiring must be detectable by the controller and must be
treated like an Implausibility, see T.4.2.4 above
T.4.2.10 When an analogue signal is used, the APPS will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.
T.4.2.11 When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the APPS signal,
a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that
have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.
b. The failures to be considered must include but are not limited to the failure of the APPS,
APPS signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the
associated time outs.
T.4.2.12 The current rules are written to only apply to the APPS (pedal), but the integrity of the torque
command signal is important in all stages.
T.4.3 Brake System Encoder - BSE
T.4.3.1 The vehicle must have a sensor or switch to measure brake pedal position or brake system
pressure
T.4.3.2 The BSE must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of:
• A separate detachable connector(s) for any BSE signal(s) to the main ECU without
affecting any other connections
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each BSE
signal(s) to the main ECU without affecting any other connections
T.4.3.3 The BSE or switch signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a
digital data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay
Any failure of the BSE or BSE wiring that persists more than 100 msec must be detectable by
the controller and treated like an implausibility and power to the (IC) electronic throttle / (EV)
Motor(s) must be immediately stopped completely.
(EV only) It is not necessary to completely deactivate the Tractive System, the motor
controller(s) stopping power to the motor(s) is sufficient.
Formula SAE® Rules 2024 © 2023 SAE International Page 65 of 140
Version 1.0 1 Sep 2023
T.4.3.4 When an analogue signal is used, the BSE sensors will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.
T.4.3.5 When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the BSE signal:
a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that
have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.
b. The failures modes must include but are not limited to the failure of the sensor, sensor
signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the
