0,V.1,"CONFIGURATION
The vehicle must be open wheeled and open cockpit (a formula style body) with four wheels
that are not in a straight line."
1,V.1.1,"Open Wheel
Open Wheel vehicles must satisfy all of the following criteria:
a. The top 180° of the wheels/tires must be unobstructed when viewed from vertically
above the wheel.
b. The wheels/tires must be unobstructed when viewed from the side.
c. No part of the vehicle may enter a keep out zone defined by two lines extending
vertically from positions 75 mm in front of and 75 mm aft of, the outer diameter of the
front and rear tires in the side view elevation of the vehicle, with tires steered straight
ahead. This keep out zone will extend laterally from the outside plane of the wheel/tire
to the inboard plane of the wheel/tire.

of moving, contact the track surface are prohibited and any unintended contact with the
ground which causes damage, or in the opinion of the Dynamic Event Officials could result in
damage to the track, will result in forfeit of a run or an entire dynamic event"

23,V.3.2.1,The Steering Wheel must be mechanically connected to the front wheels
24,V.3.2.2,Electrically actuated steering of the front wheels is prohibited
25,V.3.2.3,"Steering systems must use a rigid mechanical linkage capable of tension and compression
loads for operation"
26,V.3.2.4,"The steering system must have positive steering stops that prevent the steering linkages from
locking up (the inversion of a four bar linkage at one of the pivots). The stops:
a. Must prevent the wheels and tires from contacting suspension, bodywork, or Chassis
