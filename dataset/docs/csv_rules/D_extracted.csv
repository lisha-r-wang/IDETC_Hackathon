203,D.13.1.1,"The Efficiency is based on a metric of the amount of fuel consumed or energy used and the lap
time on the endurance course, averaged over the length of the event."
204,D.13.1.2,"The Efficiency score is based only on the distance the vehicle runs on the course during the
Endurance event, and the total fuel/energy used. No adjustment to distance or fuel/energy
will be made."
205,D.13.2,Efficiency Procedure
206,D.13.2.1,"For IC vehicles:
a. The fuel tank must be filled to the fuel level line (IC.5.4.5)
b. During fuelling, once filled to the scribe line, no shaking or tilting of the tank, fuel system,
or the entire vehicle is allowed."
